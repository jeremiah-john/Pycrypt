# Pycrypt
### Why did you make this?
This project was made as a challenge for myself, and as a teaching tool for others. I have learned a lot about working with both Python and Git, and now, my work can be used and shared freely by anyone who might need it. If you have a problem you are tackling and you find something of interest in my code, feel free to use and hack it! I take great enjoyment with helping others with my work 
### How To Use
the program closes after you encrypt or decrypt each time. Open two times to encrypt and decrypt something
### Todo
* Reduce amount of lines (always room for improvement!)
* Find more secure way to store key
