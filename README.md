# Pycrypt
### Why did you make this?
Protip: Do not use this program to encrypt sensitive data that you want to keep private. As of version 1.0, the storage of passwords needs major improvement. The program is being released into the Public Domain. I wanted to contribute to the global hacker community. Anybody can look at my code and reuse parts of it for their own program. So use GnuPG to encrypt something securely andplay around with this program. Maybe you had an idea but didn't know how to implement it. Just look through the Python script to see anything that could help.
### How To Use
the program closes after you encrypt or decrypt each time. Open two times to encrypt and decrypt something
### Todo
* Reduce amount of lines (always room for improvement!)
* Change encryption from Base64 to SHA
* Find more secure way to store key
